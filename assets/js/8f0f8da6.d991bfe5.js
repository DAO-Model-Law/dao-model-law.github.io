Such participation rights and responsibilities,\nwhether in the form of governance or financial powers, may be purchased,\nearned programmatically, granted through proposals, or distributed in\nany way defined in the DAO's By-Laws. The Model Law requires a DAO's\nsoftware code, On-Chain Assets and transaction record to be publicly\navailable and transparent to Members and Participants, so it does not\nimpose a restriction on distributions, as with traditional non-profit\ncompanies or foundations. These 'non-distribution constraints' exist in\nsuch organizations to prevent fiduciaries and key employees siphoning\nvaluable assets from the organization for personal gain, and to build\ntrust in the organization's capacity to achieve their social,\nenvironmental or charitable purpose.

A DAO\ncan delineate various governance and financial rights via its\nToken-based system and distinguish amongst its participants those\nToken-holders to whom governance powers have also been granted. This\nModel Law contemplates that only those persons holding governance rights\nshould be considered Members of the DAO who determine the actions of the\nDAO, and thus hold a higher level of responsibility. An example of an\nimportant stakeholder in the DAO ecosystem who would not be classified\nas Members are persons who hold Tokens on centralized exchanges. In such\nsituations, the user usually only has a claim on the centralized\nexchange, but doesn't have actual ownership of the Tokens, which is a\nprerequisite for membership. The lack of actual ownership of Tokens by\nusers was well demonstrated in a dispute in 2020 over the Steemit\nplatform.[^39] In March 2020, centralized exchanges, including Binance,\nPoloniex and Huobi, used user deposits of STEEM, the native Token of the\nSteemit blockchain, to help oust all of Steemit's nodes known as\n\"witnesses\" that secure the Steemit blockchain in favour of one single\nwitness (node) controlled by Tron's founder Justin Sun. The move was\nheavily criticized within the blockchain ecosystem, which has arguably\nresulted in more hesitant usage of user deposits by centralized\nexchanges. However, the matter highlights the discrepancy between legal\nownership, possession and lack of actual control by users over Token\ndeposits in centralized exchanges, which, therefore, should not qualify\nas conferring membership rights."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"This Article does not apply to Contentious Forks (Article 16 and\ncommentary).

Because these\nreplications can occur without affirmative action on the part of\nParticipants, this Model Law does not contemplate that governance\nresponsibilities should be automatically conferred to Members of a DAO\ninvoluntarily subject to a Hard Fork. As described in Chapter 5, there\nare several factors to be considered in the determination of the\nmajority fork. Ultimately, individual participants and market\naggregations decide which fork emerges as the authoritative counterparty\nin transactions.
