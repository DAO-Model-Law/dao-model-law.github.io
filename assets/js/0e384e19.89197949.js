States are encouraged to adopt or transpose the ML's provisions into their domestic law. In a State that has transposed or adopted the ML into their domestic legal system, a DAO that is constituted according to the requirements of the transposed or adopted legal rules will qualify and be recognized as a legal entity by that State. This will result in the DAO being granted legal personality in any State that has adopted or transposed the ML, which is essential to guarantee the legal effect of the DAO's action. If the ML's provisions are complied with, the DAO's Members will additionally enjoy limited liability. To allow for DAOs to qualify as legal entities in the maximum number of States, the ML provides a minimum level of rights, duties and protections that are generally recognized in legislation on analogous corporate entities in major jurisdictions. In addition, if a DAO qualifies as a legal entity in a particular jurisdiction, the legal effects of its actions and the protections offered to its Members, Participants, Legal Representatives and Administrators may be more easily recognized in other jurisdictions that have not adopted or transposed the ML under private international law principles."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As many unregistered DAOs will fail to comply with existing corporate rules by nature of their intrinsic operation, and will not be able to implement all of the necessary legal requirements formally articulated in existing corporate rules, the ML strives to achieve functional and regulatory equivalence through specific provisions of the ML. Functional equivalence allows the establishment of equivalence between an object already within the realm of a legal rule and another object not yet encompassed by it. For instance, the UNCITRAL Model Law for Electronic Commerce establishes functional equivalence between a paper-based document and an electronic document. As this Model Law demonstrates, this approach is useful for simplifying the regulation of DAOs. For example, instead of introducing new corporate rules specifically applicable to 'tokenized' shares, shares that are recorded on a blockchain-based system could be regarded as valid titles to a share, transferable via a blockchain-based registry. Regulatory equivalence relies on the same technique, but identifies the object or purpose of any given regulation as goal. It allows for the establishment of equivalence between the function of a legal rule and the function of a technology. A pertinent example of regulatory equivalence is the relationship between registration requirements for corporate entities and the deployment of a DAO on a Permissionless Blockchain. The deployment of a smart contract on a blockchain with relevant data about a DAO is not functionally equivalent to registration into a corporate registry, but the policy objectives of publicity and certainty are fully achieved. Following a public announcement of the Public Address of the DAO, the deployment is verifiable by anyone, as it is inscribed on a Permissionless Blockchain."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In view of the above objectives, the ML consists of the following Chapters:"}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(t.h1,{id:"chapter-list",children:"Chapter list"}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.h2,{id:"chapter-1-general-provisions",children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.a,{href:"#chapter-1",children:"Chapter 1"}),".
