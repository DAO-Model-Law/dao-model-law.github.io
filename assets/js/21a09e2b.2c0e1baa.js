In the late\n1770s, in writing about penal law, Bentham posed the question: "Who are\nyou, with whom I have to deal?"[^16] This question strikes at the heart\nof the problem of being able to accurately and truthfully identify a\nstranger. At the time, the lack of standardization of proper names\nprovided numerous opportunities to deceive counterparties.

Through the formation requirements\nmentioned in this Article 4, we strive for regulatory equivalence by\nmeeting this identifiability objective, while also acknowledging the\nunique properties of DAOs and the implicit goal of DAOs to conduct\ntransactions digitally and maintain the pseudonymity of Administrators,\nMembers and Participants."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(i.p,{children:"An example of this is Article 4(1)(b), which requires the specification\nof a Public Address.

The public policy goal requiring a company to have a name to\ndistinguish one company from another is met by the identification of a\nPublic Address of a DAO, which may be considered its default name in the\nabsence of a unique name communicated by Public Signaling.

In general, a\nphysical, registered address---even if limited to a mailbox---is\nimportant due to the need for Persons or the legal system to serve legal\ndocuments.

Instead of requiring a DAO to submit to and physically establish\na presence in every jurisdiction in which they operate, the Dispute\nResolution Mechanism gives Members and other stakeholders means of\nredress against the DAO, should the need arise. Dispute Resolution\nMechanisms with non-member third parties do not have to meet minimum\nstandards of due process for the time being, as no on-chain ADR process\ncurrently meets such standards and is unlikely to do so in the\nforeseeable future.
