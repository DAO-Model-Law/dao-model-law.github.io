The policy\nobjectives of having a minimum capital requirement include protecting\ncreditors, signaling the availability of certain assets to meet the\nclaims of creditors (particularly involuntary ones who cannot bargain\nfor better protections), preventing the frivolous formation of limited\nliability companies, demonstrating that a new business is credit-worthy\nand nudging directors to recapitalize an undercapitalized business.[^34]\nHowever, as is current practice with private limited liability companies\nin several jurisdictions,[^35] we do not see minimum capital\nsubscription as being necessary for DAOs, due to its inadequacy in\nserving its main intended purpose: protecting creditors from members and\nfiduciaries siphoning assets.[^36] In the European Union, the ",(0,n.jsx)(t.em,{children:"Centros"}),"\njudgment has made clear that companies are free to circumvent minimum\ncapital rules by registering in a foreign jurisdiction which provides\nlower minimum capital requirements, given that there are other\nmechanisms to protect the interests of creditors.[^37] The paying-up of\na portion of minimum capital prior to the formation and operation of a\nbusiness does not prevent the business from returning the cash of\npromoters as a salary, in exchange for goodwill or as a loan soon after\nit becomes operational.[^38] Nor are the sums committed to these\nbusinesses typically sufficient to meet the claims of unsecured,\ninvoluntary creditors, such as employees. Voluntary creditors do not\nlook towards minimum capital to determine the credit-worthiness of a\nbusiness but instead concentrate on other metrics such as net worth or\ncash flow, as well as the business's ability to furnish security. Given\nexisting market-based challenges and formation requirements imposed by\nthis Model Law, we do not see a justification for creating an additional\nbarrier to entry to small, under-resourced DAOs in the form of a minimum\ncapital requirement, particularly where such a requirement is rapidly\nfalling out of favor for the reasons discussed above."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Instead, as the inherent technical features of a Permissionless\nBlockchain and this Model Law require a DAO's software code, On-Chain\nAssets and transaction records to be publicly available (Article\n4(1)(e)), the financial position of a DAO and the risks inherent in it\nare made transparent to any creditors. As such, the signaling functions\nof minimum capital requirements are achieved through technological\nmeans. Furthermore, DAOs have diverse mechanisms for entry and exit\ndesigned according to the needs of their Members, such as withdrawal of\nTokens (akin to the withdrawal of shares in cooperatives in the UK) or\nthe transfer of TTokens to third parties (akin to the transfer of shares\nin limited liability companies).
