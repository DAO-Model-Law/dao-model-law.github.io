According to Harris, limited liability evolved since the\n1600s over three distinct periods from a system of no limited liability\n(circa. 1600-1800) to a multiplicity of hybrid liability regimes (circa.\n1800-1930) to 'strong' owner shielding in the twentieth century.[^22] It\nwas only in this third period that creditors were granted legal priority\nover equity holders in claiming corporate assets."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"There are several legal and economic grounds for why limited liability\nbecame a uniform attribute of the corporation. With the growth of large,\ncomplex corporations in the United States with dispersed shareholding\nstructures, it became apparent that it was untenable for individual\nshareholders to have 'moral culpability'[^23] for the actions of\ncorporations, as they lacked the power and control mechanisms to\ndiscipline errant management. At the same time, limited liability allows\nrisk-averse persons to take business risks that they may have otherwise\navoided, thereby enhancing the chances of gaining a lucrative return, as\nthe risks of a poor investment are shifted onto creditors and other\nthird parties.[^24] Ordinarily, shareholders that enjoy limited\nliability only stand to lose what they have invested in the event of\ninsolvency. As a consequence, shareholders are also able to invest in\nmultiple corporations without having to closely monitor any of\nthem.[^25] This is a clear example of how corporate legal requirements\nevolved to address the inherent trade-offs underlying public policy\ngoals to enhance or enable political and social economies afforded by\nimplementation of such rules. Voluntary creditors are able to, however,\nprotect themselves from the moral hazard of shareholders by imposing\nhigher interest rates on any loans extended to the corporation and by\nnegotiating limitations on actions that a corporation can take without\ncreditor approval. Involuntary creditors, such as tort victims, may seek\nto pierce the corporate veil so as to satisfy the claims they may have\nagainst individual shareholders or parent companies, but globally such\nefforts at veil piercing are generally unsuccessful outside of cases of\nfraud."}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["As a corollary to this, there are legal and economic grounds for why\nunlimited liability is less favored by contemporary corporate entities,\nalthough certain corporate entities have unlimited liability as a\nmandatory rule (",(0,n.jsx)(t.em,{children:"e.g."}),", in general partnerships) or as a default rule\n(",(0,n.jsx)(t.em,{children:"e.g."}),", cooperative societies in some jurisdictions).

For voluntary and involuntary creditors,[^28] joint and\nseveral liability may also lose its appeal when confronted with the\nreality that they would potentially have to pursue individual claims\nagainst several, dispersed Members. It is arguable that it is even\nunfair that creditors be able to arbitrarily pursue actions against\nindividual Members, based on the accessibility of the Members'\njurisdiction or wealth.
