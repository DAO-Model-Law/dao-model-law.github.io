This is\nprimarily due to the fact that its processes and procedures are\npredefined and deterministic, carried out by code existing in\ncyberspace. Furthermore, the emergence of blockchain-based anonymization\ntechniques and decentralized exchanges compromise the enforcement of a\nregulatory framework for taxation akin to that of cloud-based agents.

In addition, Airdrops as defined in\nArticle 3(4) pose additional unresolved complexity for the tax laws of\nnational jurisdictions.
